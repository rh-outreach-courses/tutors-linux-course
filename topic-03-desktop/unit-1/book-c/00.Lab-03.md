# .Bashrc

Configuring the Linux terminal

The terminal in Linux uses the Bash language and can be configured using a hidden file called .bashrc. This file is a script that runs each time a bew terminal session starts and allows users to customise their shell environment and define settings that are automatically loaded each time they open a new terminal window. The default location for this file is `~/.bashrc`
