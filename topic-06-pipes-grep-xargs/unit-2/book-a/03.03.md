# Hands On Lab

Now that you have learned how to use "pipes" and tried out some examples. It is time to practice what you have learned.

## Pre Requisites

We first want to create a new text file called `car_brands.txt` that contains a list of car brands. We will use this file in the following excerises. You can try create this file yourself based on the example given in the previous section.

The car brands are as follows:
```
Toyota
Ford
Volkswagen
Volvo
BMW
Mercedes
Audi
Honda
Fiat
Renault
```

  ```bash
  cat << 'EOF' > car_brands.txt
  Toyota
  Ford
  Volkswagen
  Volvo
  BMW
  Mercedes
  Audi
  Honda
  Fiat
  Renault
  EOF
  ```

</details>
