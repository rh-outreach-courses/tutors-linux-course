# Examples of Pipes in Action

Below are some examples of how you can use pipes to chain commands together.

## Pre Requisites

We first need to create a file called `words.txt` that contains a list of words. We will use this file in the examples below.

You can create the file by copying and pasting the following command into your terminal:

```bash
cat << 'EOF' > words.txt
open-source
enterprise
Linux
innovation
Fedora
community
cloud
security
virtualization
reliability
performance
container
automation
integration
ecosystem
support
scalable
robust
cutting-edge
collaboration
EOF
```

Now you can verify that the file was created by running the following command:

```bash
cat words.txt
```

If you see the list of words displayed in the terminal, then the file 
was created successfully and you are ready to start with the examples below.


## Example 1 - Counting Files

The following command will `cat words.txt` and pipe the output to "wc" and count the number of lines in the file.

```bash

cat words.txt | wc -l

```
### Explanation:

- `cat words.txt` will display the contents of the file `words.txt`.
- `|` is the pipe operator that sends the output of the previous command to the next command.
- `wc -l` will count the number of lines in the input it receives.

## Example 2 - Sorting a List of Items

The following command will cat `words.txt` and pipe the output to sort the words in alphabetical order.

```bash

cat words.txt | sort

```

### Explanation:

- `cat words.txt` will display the contents of the file `words.txt`.
- `|` is the pipe operator that sends the output of the previous command to the next command.
- `sort` will sort the input it receives in descending aplhabetical order.

  <summary>Answer</summary>
  If you run the command `cat words.txt | sort` you should see the words in the following order:
```
automation
cloud
collaboration
community
container
cutting-edge
ecosystem
enterprise
Fedora
innovation
integration
Linux
open-source
performance
reliability
robust
scalable
security
support
virtualization
```

## Example 3 - Showing the First 10 Lines of a File

The following command will cat `words.txt` and pipe the output to "head" and display the first 10 lines of the file.

```bash

cat words.txt | head

```

### Explanation:

- `cat words.txt` will display the contents of the file `words.txt`.
- `|` is the pipe operator that sends the output of the previous command to the next command.
- `head` will display the first 10 lines of the input it receives.

  If you run the command `cat words.txt | head` you should see the following output:

```
open-source
enterprise
Linux
innovation
Fedora
community
cloud
security
virtualization
reliability
```

## Example 4 - Showing The First 10 Lines of a File and Sorting Them

The following command will `cat words.txt` and pipe the output to "head" and display the first 10 lines of the file. Then it will pipe the output to "sort" which will sort the words in alphabetical order.

```bash

cat words.txt | head -n 10 | sort

```

### Explanation:

- `cat words.txt` will display the contents of the file `words.txt`.
- `|` is the pipe operator that sends the output of the previous command to the next command.
- `head` will display the first 10 lines of the input it receives.
- `sort` will sort the input it receives in descending aplhabetical order.

  If you run the command `cat words.txt | head -n 10 | sort`, you should see the following output:

  ```
  cloud
  community
  enterprise
  Fedora
  innovation
  Linux
  open-source
  reliability
  security
  virtualization
  ```
