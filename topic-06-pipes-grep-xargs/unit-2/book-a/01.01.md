# Understanding Pipes

## What Are Pipes?

**Pipes** (|) allow you to take the output of one command and pass it as stadard input to another command. This allows you to chain multiple commands together to perform complex operations.

### Key Concepts:
- Pipes send data directly from one command to the next without the need for outputing to a file.

- By chaining commands together you can create long sequences of operations that process data quickly.

- Rather than writing scripts, you can use pipes to combine utilities like `ls`, `grep`, `cat`, and more.


## Why Use Pipes?

Using pipes in your command line workflow offers many benefits:

- Each command does one thing well. By linking them you build a powerful tool that can perform complex operations.

- Direct data transfer between commands make pipes faster than writing and reading files between commands.

- You can mix and match different commands to tackle a wide range of tasks from filtering text to processing data in files.
