# Examples of Xargs in Action

Below are some example of how you can use xargs to build and execute commands.

## Pre Requisites

We will be using the files we have created in the "pipes" example and lab `words.txt` and `car_brands.txt` and the `app.log` that we created in grep example. If you haven't done so already you can create the files by following the instructions in the previous examples.

## Example 1 - Basic Echo

The following command will echo each word in the list of words.txt.

```bash

cat words.txt | xargs -n 1 echo

```

### Explanation:

- `cat words.txt` will display the contents of the file `words.txt`.
- `|` is the pipe operator that sends the output of the previous command to the next command.
- xargs:
    - `-n 1` will pass each word as an argument to the `echo` command.
    - `echo` will display the word.

  Linux
  innovation
  Fedora
  community

  security
  virtualization
  reliability
  performance
  container
  automation
  integration
  ecosystem
  support
  scalable
  robust
  cutting-edge
  collaboration

  ```

## Example 2 - Delete a List of Files

The following command will delete each file in the list of files.txt.

Note: This command will not work if you have not created the files `file1.txt`, `file2.txt` and `file3.txt`. You can create the files by running the following command:

```bash

touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt

```
Now you can run the following command to delete the files using `xargs`.

```bash

echo "file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt" | xargs rm

```

### Explanation:

- `echo "file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt"` will display the list of files.
- `|` is the pipe operator that sends the output of the previous command to the next command.
- xargs:
    - `rm` is the command to remove files.

<details>
  <summary>Output</summary>

  Remember to run `ls` to see the files before and after running the command:

  ```bash

  ls
  file1.txt  file2.txt  file3.txt
  echo "file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt" | xargs rm
  ls

  ```

</details>

## Example 3 - Limit Arguments Per Command

The following command will echo the words in groups of 3.

```bash

cat car_brands.txt | xargs -n 3 echo

```

### Explanation:

- `cat car_brands.txt` will display the contents of the file `car_brands.txt`.
- `|` is the pipe operator that sends the output of the previous command to the next command.
- xargs:
    - `-n 3` will pass each group of 3 words as arguments to the `echo` command.
    - `echo` will display the words.

<details>
  <summary>Output</summary>

  Here is the output you will see when you run the command:

  ```bash

  Toyota Ford Volkswagen
  Volvo BMW Mercedes
  Audi Honda Fiat
  Renault

  ```
</details>

## Example 4 - Using a Replacement String

The following command will create a file for each word in the list of words.txt.

```bash

cat words.txt | xargs -I {} touch {}.txt

```

### Explanation:

- `cat words.txt` will display the contents of the file `words.txt`.
- `|` is the pipe operator that sends the output of the previous command to the next command.
- xargs:
    - `-I {}` will replace `{}` with the argument.
    - `touch {}.txt` will create a file with the name of the word and the extension `.txt`.

<details>
  <summary>Output</summary>

  Here is the output you will see when you run the command:

  ```bash

  ls
  words.txt
  cat words.txt | xargs -I {} touch {}.txt
  ls
  automation.txt     community.txt     ecosystem.txt   innovation.txt   open-source.txt  robust.txt    support.txt
  cloud.txt          container.txt     enterprise.txt  integration.txt  performance.txt  scalable.txt  virtualization.txt
  collaboration.txt  cutting-edge.txt  Fedora.txt      Linux.txt        reliability.txt  security.txt  words.txt

  ```

## Example 5 - Creating Directories

This command will create directories dir1, dir2, and dir3.

```bash

echo "dir1 dir2 dir3" | xargs -n 1 mkdir

```

### Explanation:

- `echo "dir1 dir2 dir3"` will display the list of directories.
- `|` is the pipe operator that sends the output of the previous command to the next command.
-  xargs:
    - `-n 1` will pass each directory as an argument to the `mkdir` command.
    - `mkdir` is the command to create directories.

<details>
  <summary>Output</summary>

  Here is the output you will see when you run "ls" after running the command:

  ```bash

  ls
  dir1  dir2  dir3

  ```

## Example 6 - Prepending Text to Each Line

The following command will prepend "Brand: [volvo]" to each car brand in the list of `car_brands.txt`.

```bash

cat car_brands.txt | xargs -I {} echo "Brand: {}"

```

### Explanation:

- `cat car_brands.txt` will display the contents of the file `car_brands.txt`.
- `|` is the pipe operator that sends the output of the previous command to the next command.
- xargs:
    - `-I {}` will replace `{}` with the argument.

Example 7 - Reading Arguments From a File

The following command will read car brand names directly from the file `car_brands.txt` and echo each one.

```bash

xargs -a car_brands.txt -I {} echo "Car Brand: {}"

```

### Explanation:

- `xargs -a car_brands.txt` will read the arguments from the file `car_brands.txt`.
- `-I {}` will replace `{}` with the argument.
- `echo "Car Brand: {}"` will build and execute the `echo` command for each word in the input it receives, replacing `{}` with the car brand.

<details>
  <summary>Output</summary>

## Example 8 - Running Multiple Commands in Parallel

The following command will create a 100 files in parallel using xargs.


```bash

echo file{1..100}.txt | xargs -P 10 -I {} sh -c 'echo "Creating {}" && touch {}'

```

### Explanation:

- `echo file{1..100}.txt` will display the list of files.
- `|` is the pipe operator that sends the output of the previous command to the next command.
- xaargs:
    - `-P 10` will run 10 instances of the command in parallel.
    - `-I {}` will replace `{}` with the argument.

## Example 9 - Avoiding Execution on Empty Input

The following command will only execute the command if there are arguments in the input.

```bash

echo "" | xargs -r echo "Files to process."

```

```bash

echo "rhel.txt" | xargs -r echo "Files to process."

```

### Explanation:

- `echo ""` will display an empty string.
- `|` is the pipe operator that sends the output of the previous command to the next command.
-  xargs:
    - `-r` will not run the command if there are no arguments.
    - `echo "Files to process."` will display the message "Files to process."

<details>
  <summary>Output</summary> 

  When you run the command `echo "" | xargs -r echo "Files to process."`, you will not see any output because there are no arguments. However, when you run the command `echo "rhel.txt" | xargs -r echo "Files to process."`, you should see the output `Files to process. rhel.txt`.
  
    ```bash

    $ echo "" | xargs -r echo "Files to process."
    $ echo "rhel.txt" | xargs -r echo "Files to process."
    $ Files to process. rhel.txt

    ```

## Example 10 - Advanced Pipeline: Filtering and Reversing Words

The following command will extract IP addresses from a log file, sort them, remove duplicates, and then ping each IP address.

```bash

grep -E -o "[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+" app.log | sort | uniq | xargs -I {} sh -c 'echo "Pinging {}:" && ping -c 1 {}'

```

Note: You dont have to run this above command as it will take time to execute and may not hace the same output as shown below.

### Explanation:

- `grep -E -o "[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+" app.log` will search for IP addresses in the file `app.log`.
- `|` is the pipe operator that sends the output of the previous command to the next command.
- `sort` will sort the IP addresses.
- `uniq` will remove duplicate IP addresses.
-  xargs:
    - `-I {}` will replace `{}` with the argument.
    - `sh -c 'echo "Pinging {}:" && ping -c 1 {}'` will build and execute the `echo` and `ping` commands for each IP address in the input it receives, replacing `{}` with the IP address.

## Conclusion

Now you have seen some examples of how to use "xargs" to build and execute commands from standard input and files. You should be able to use this knowledge to tackle the hands-on lab that follows.
