# Hands On Lab

Now that you have learned how to use `xargs` and tried some examples. It is time to practice what you have learned.

## Pre Requisites

We will be using the files we have created in the pipes example and lab `words.txt` and `car_brands.txt` and the app.log that we created in grep example. If you haven't done so already you can create the files by following the instructions in the previous examples.

## Exercise 1 - Prepend "Word: [linux]" to Each Entry

Add the prefix "Word: [open-source]" to each word in the file `words.txt`.

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

  ```bash
  cat words.txt | xargs -n 1 -I {} echo "Word: {}"
  ```

  Explanation:
  - `cat words.txt` will display the contents of the file `words.txt`.
  - `|` is the pipe operator that sends the output of the previous command to the next command.
  -  xargs:
      - `-n 1` tells xargs to use one argument at a time.
      - `-I {}` tells xargs to replace `{}` with the argument.
      - `echo "Word: {}"` will prepend the word "Word: " to each word in the file.

## Exercise 2 - Create a New File for Each Car Brand

Create a new file for each car brand in the file `car_brands.txt`.

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

  ```bash
  cat car_brands.txt | xargs -n 1 -I {} touch {}.txt
  ```

  Explanation:
  - `cat car_brands.txt` will display the contents of the file `car_brands.txt`.
  - `|` is the pipe operator that sends the output of the previous command to the next command.
  - xargs:
      - `-n 1` tells xargs to use one argument at a time.
      - `-I {}` tells xargs to replace `{}` with the argument.
      - `touch {}.txt` will create a new file with the name of the car brand and the extension `.txt`.

## Exercise 3 - Remove All Files Created in `Exercise 2`

Remove all the files created in Exercise 2.

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

  ```bash
  cat car_brands.txt | xargs -n 1 -I {} rm {}.txt
  ```

  Explanation:
  - `cat car_brands.txt` will display the contents of the file `car_brands.txt`.

  - `|` is the pipe operator that sends the output of the previous command to the next command.

  - xargs:
      - `-n 1` tells xargs to use one argument at a time.
      - `-I {}` tells xargs to replace `{}` with the argument.
      - `rm {}.txt` will remove the file with the name of the car brand and the extension `.txt`.

## Exercise 4 - Create your own command using xargs

Can you come up with your own command using xargs that uses the file `app.log`?

## Exercise 5 - Create your own command using xargs and grep

Can you come up with your own command using xargs and grep that uses the file `car_brand.txt`?


## Conclusion

You should now have a good understanding of how to use `xargs` to process data on the command line. You now have come to the end of the labs for this course. You should now have a understanding of how to use pipes, grep and xargs to process data on the command line.
