# Examples of Grep in Action

Below are some examples of how you can use the "grep" command to search for patterns in text files.

## Pre Requisites

We first need to create two files that contain text. We will use these files in the examples below. You can create the files by copying and pasting the following commands into your terminal:

The below file is called `app.log` and contains log messages from an application.
```bash
cat << 'EOF' > app.log

The below is a configuration file called `setup.conf` that contains configuration settings.
```bash
cat << 'EOF' > setup.conf

[general]
app_name = MyApp
version = 1.0.0

[network]
host = localhost
port = 8080
timeout = 30

[database]

```

## Example 1 - Searching For a Pattern

The following command will search for the pattern "WARNING" in the file `app.log`.

```bash

grep -i -n -C 1 "warning" app.log

```

### Explanation:

- `grep` is the command line utility for searching patterns in files.
- `-i` is an option that makes the search non case-sensitive.
- `-n` is an option that displays the line number of each matching line.
- `-C 1` is an option that displays one line of context before and after the matching line.
- `"WARNING"` is the pattern we are searching for.
- `app.log` is the file we are searching in.

  ```
</details>

## Example 2 - Searching For a Pattern in Multiple Files

The following command will search for the pattern "port" in the files `app.log` and `setup.conf`.

```bash

grep -i -n "port" app.log setup.conf

```

### Explanation:

- `grep` is the command line utility for searching patterns in files.
- `-i` is an option that makes the search non case-sensitive.
- `-n` is an option that displays the line number of each matching line.
- `"port"` is the pattern we are searching for.
- `app.log` and `setup.conf` are the files we are searching in.

  setup.conf:8:port = 8080
  ```

</details>

## Example 3 - Searching For a Pattern Recursively

The following command will search for the pattern "mailbox" in all files in the current directory and its subdirectories.

```bash

grep -i -r -n "mailbox" .

```

### Explanation:

- `grep` is the command line utility for searching patterns in files.
- `-i` is an option that makes the search non case-sensitive.
- `-r` is an option that makes the search recursive.
- `-n` is an option that displays the line number of each matching line.
- `"mailbox"` is the pattern we are searching for.
- `.` specifies the current directory as the starting point for the search.

  ./app.log:59:03/22 08:51:06 INFO   :....mailbox_register: mailbox allocated for rsvp-udp
  ```

## Example 4 - Searching for Whole Words Only

The following command will search for the whole word "port" in the file `setup.conf`.

```bash

grep -i -w -n "port" setup.conf

```

### Explanation:

- `grep` is the command line utility for searching patterns in files.
- `-i` is an option that makes the search non case-sensitive.
- `-w` is an option that matches whole words only.
- `-n` is an option that displays the line number of each matching line.
- `"port"` is the pattern we are searching for.
- `setup.conf` is the file we are searching in.

  ```bash
  8:port = 8080
  ```

## Example 5 - Using Pipes With Grep

The following command will search for the pattern "INFO" in the file `app.log` and then sort the output.

```bash

grep -i "INFO" app.log | sort

```

### Explanation:

- `grep` is the command line utility for searching patterns in files.
- `-i` is an option that makes the search non case-sensitive.
- `"INFO"` is the pattern we are searching for.
- `app.log` is the file we are searching in.
- `|` is the pipe operator that sends the output of the previous command to the next command.
- `sort` will sort the output in descending alphabetical order

## Example 6 - Piping Grep With Other Commands

The following command will search for the pattern "INFO" in the file `app.log`, then sort the output and finally display the first 5 lines.

```bash

grep -i "INFO" app.log | sort | head -n 5

```

### Explanation:

- `grep` is the command line utility for searching patterns in files.
- `-i` is an option that makes the search non case-sensitive.
- `"INFO"` is the pattern we are searching for.
- `app.log` is the file we are searching in.
- `|` is the pipe operator that sends the output of the previous command to the next command.
- `sort` will sort the output in descending alphabetical order
- `head -n 5` will display the first 5 lines of the input it receives.

## Conclusion

Now you have seen some examples of how to use grep to search for patterns in text files. You should be able to use this knowledge to tackle the handson lab that follows.
