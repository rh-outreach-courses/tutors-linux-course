# Why

These file will be used in later challenges.

But really know why you are trying to achieve some task is really usefully for understand what the person is expecting.
The format for a ticket (task) of What, Why, How and Done is very common. 
Here I want to talk a bit about this challenge.

This challenge is not easy, and uses tools covered by this course, but also may require other tools.
The reason for being hard is as a developer the problem you are trying to solve are just outside your understanding.
As we move through our careers we want to be facing harder problems.
One of the key's skill in facing harder problems is understanding that you don't have all the answers yet.
The more problems we solve the harder the problems we can face. 

This can give the sense of never getting better, but you are. 
In six months, a year or even two years look back on some of the past problems you need to solve, and ask do you still think that they are hard.

So this challenge is one of the first problems that may seem out of reach. 
The main goal of the challenge is not to solve the challenge, but to solve the problem of how to solve the challenge.
It's about can you be given a task and find the answer.
However, you find the answer is up to you.
